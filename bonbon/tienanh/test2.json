      "passage": "ASEAN countries are known for their rich cultural traditions and celebrations. These celebrations, often marked by colourful parades and performances, are an important way to honour ancestors, strengthen community bonds, and promote regional cooperation and understanding.\n\nOne of the most popular cultural celebrations in many ASEAN countries is the Lunar New Year, which takes place in late January or early February. Based on the lunar calendar, this holiday is a time to honour ancestors, make offerings of food and gifts, and wish for prosperity and good fortune in the coming year. During the Lunar New Year, people often take part in traditional activities such as tug of war, bamboo dancing, stilt walking, dragon and lion dances, and the lighting of firecrackers to scare away bad luck.\n\nAnother popular cultural celebration in many ASEAN countries is the Water Festival, which takes place in April or May. This festival, also known as Songkran in Thailand, celebrates the start of the rainy season and the power of water to wash away bad luck and start fresh. During the festival, people splash water on each other in the streets and participate in other fun activities.\n\nIn addition to these celebrations, many ASEAN countries also have unique cultural traditions and practices that are specific to their region or community. For example, in Viet Nam, people often release lanterns into the sky during the Mid-Autumn Festival to symbolize the desire for a bright future. In Indonesia, people celebrate the end of Ramadan with a feast known as Idul Fitri, which is a time to strengthen community bonds and forgive past grievances.\n\nOverall, cultural celebrations are an important part of life in ASEAN countries, promoting regional identity, cultural exchange, and mutual support among communities.",
